# Machine-Learning-k-NN-Classifier

In this project, I developed a classifier that predicts clothing items from images, employing cutting-edge libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. I meticulously engineered features, optimized models, and employed neural networks to enhance prediction accuracy. This project also includes a thorough analysis of model performance, featuring precision-recall curves and confusion matrices, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. My systematic approach to data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation demonstrates a strong foundation in machine learning concepts and a commitment to delivering robust, scalable solutions. This work is a testament to my ability to harness the power of AI to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.
